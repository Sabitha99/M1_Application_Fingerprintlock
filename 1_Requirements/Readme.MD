# **Introduction:**

Fingerprint lock is system works on the basics of matching algorithm. Based on this algorithm we compare previously stored fingerprint with the finger print used for authentication purpose. The sensor used in fingerprint recognition is usually optical sensor, It works based on the system that it capture the finger ridges photo, compares it with the stored data and Displays the result.

# **Research**

Security has become a major concern in the developing world and hence it must not be compromised in any way. This paper discusses about the security system that can help to reduce the theft in banks, ATM, military base camps, research centres and places where security has the highest priority.

# **Feature and Timeline**

- The system is fast, user friendly
-  The system is more accurate and clear, it is very unique.

# **SWOT ANALYSIS**

**Strength**

- It Surpass Security protection, convenience and speed.
- It is a unique identification tool.
- Impossible to hack fingerprints.

**Weakness**

- Countless scanning may lead to health issues.

**Opportunity**

- Door Lock

**Threats**

- Physical copy or spoof of your fingerprint.

# **4W&#39;s and 1H**

**Who**

- Army persons, Bank owners.

**What**

- Fingerprint door lock.

When

- To improve security and keep the things safe.

**Where**

- Police stations, Military offices, Banks.

**How**

- By keeping any finger in the system the ridges is compared with the stored finger print in the device.
